nvds_logger is a basic logging library accompanying DeepStream and related software such as adaptors, apps etc.
It is based on syslog and offers many of the related functionality, including:
* different priorities (log levels)
* log filtering and redirection
* shared logging across different deepstream instances executing simultanously
* log retirement and management (using logrotate)
* cross platform support

See setup_dslog.sh script to setup nvds_logger

Usage:
1) Setup nvds_logger (one time basis across system reboots):
chmod u+x ./setup_nvds_logger.sh 
sudo ./setup_nvds_logger.sh 

Note that the script enables various levels that help filter logs.
Please edit the script to set the log level, as mentioned in the comments within.

Programmatic usage:
For emitting logs from within your source code, follow these three steps

1) Before emitting log messages, application needs to call nvds_log_open function

2) Call nvds_log to emit log messages

3) Prepend the log messages with a keyword (ex: DSLOG)
and match the prepended keyword in setup_nvds_logger.sh

4) Finally close log by calling nvds_log_close upon completion (to flush logs)

NOTE: The log file is now found at /var/log/nvds/ds.log by default. Logs must be in /var/log/ for apparmor to
allow rsyslog access. The setup script can be used to choose a filepath but it will always be prepended by /var/log/nvds/.
